[{"content":"Introduction When sizing a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, several factors come into play such as the expected workload, resource requirements, performance needs etc. Similar to performance, scalability is a very critical factor to the success of a growing organisation which should be considered during the design of a cluster.\nScalability of a Kubernetes cluster is not one dimensional but a combination of a lot of components. When considering the scalability of a Kubernetes cluster, a better way to think about scalability is that within all possible configurations of the cluster there is a cube which wraps an envelope of those configurations which will offer you good stability and performance and as long as you are within that envelope essentially meaning within the limits of scalability on multiple dimensions you are safe and you can say that you are within the scalability limits.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the dimensions that describe the configurations of the cube are not independent. This means that moving further in any one dimension may contract the viable space in the other dimensions. In practical terms, this means that increasing scalability in one area may come at the cost of reduced scalability in another area.\nOne potential solution to this issue is to decompose the cube into independent sub-cubes. This approach can help reduce the dimensionality of the problem and make it easier to focus on specific areas of scalability. By breaking down the cube into smaller, more manageable parts, it is possible to more effectively analyze and optimize each individual component.\nDefining a Kubernetes cluster The Kubernetes cluster can scale within a range and limits to accommodate workloads and resource demands effectively. Kubernetes scalability envelope defines the boundaries and constraints of scalability based on various factors such as cluster size, node capacity, resource allocation and performance requirements. The scalability envelope helps cluster administrators and operators understand the cluster‚Äôs capabilities and plan for scaling appropriately.\nThe key considerations during designing a cluster include:\nCluster Size: Sizing a cluster correctly to accommodate all the workloads is very important. Resource is not cheap, if we oversize a cluster, we waste resources ü§¶ and if we undersize the cluster, we get production issues üòõ. Sizing basically takes into account the desired number of worker nodes in the cluster. It defines the minimum and maximum limits for the number of nodes that can be added or removed from the cluster to handle workload fluctuations efficiently. Node Capacity: Each worker node in the cluster has its own capacity in terms of CPU, memory, and other resources. Kubernetes can work with a wide range of node sizes. Choose appropriate worker node instance types based on CPU, memory, and other resource specifications. Using the most cost effective node size that the cloud provider offers is considered an optimal solution but often times larger nodes works out to be cheaper. This increases pod density and the pods are not scattered out in the cluster which minimizes the idea of pod replication and high availability in case of a node failure. In these cases try adding some smaller nodes too to help with redundancy. Resource Allocation: The scalability envelope includes resource allocation considerations such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. It defines the minimum and maximum limits for resource allocation per pod, ensuring that the cluster can scale within those limits without overcommitting or under-utilizing resources. High Availability: Ensure sufficient redundancy and fault tolerance by sizing your cluster with multiple worker nodes. This helps distribute the workload and prevent a single point of failure. Future Growth: Consider future growth and scalability needs of your application or addition of new applications. Plan for potential increases in workload, additional features, or user base expansion. Ensure that the cluster sizing accounts for these future requirements. Kubernetes Scalability Thresholds Quoting Kubernetes official community documentation, scalability thresholds is defined on the basis of ‚ÄúYou Promise, We Promise‚Äù principle\nIf you promise to:\ncorrectly configure your cluster use extensibility features \u0026ldquo;reasonably\u0026rdquo; keep the load in the cluster within recommended limits then we promise that your cluster scales, i.e.:\nall the SLOs are satisfied More on Kubernetes scalability thresholds here and here\nSizing a real world production kubernetes cluster üëá below. This calculation can be taken as a reference and modified as per the requirements.\nSizing a Kubernetes Cluster, an example For reference, we are using GKE as our cloud provider.\nGoal The goal is to define the configurations for a Kubernetes Cluster.\nCalculating Total Capacity Considering the total requirement of CPU and Memory in the Cluster is 90 vCPU and 250 GBs. Total number of replicas(pods) in the cluster is 40. Mean requirement of a pod is 2 vCPU and 4 GB.\nNode size (number of nodes) Decision: n2-standard-8 Rationale: We do not want to go with a bigger node size to avoid the larger blast radius in case of a single node failure. Max nodes in the Cluster Decision: 32 total, 28 usable Rationale: For a max CPU limit in the existing cluster of 90 vCPU and memory of 250 GB, 12 nodes n2-standard-8 will have 96(=12*8) CPU. Keeping twice the capacity of the required resources as a buffer, we would need a total of 24 nodes. As per GKE recommendations, we need to use /27 which results in 28 (4 nodes are reserved by GKE ) nodes cluster. The first two and last two IP addresses of a primary IP address range are reserved by Google Cloud. Pods/node Decision: 32 Rationale: As per GKE autopilot recommendations, the autopilot clusters can have a maximum of 32 Pods per node. As with the GKE standard, this results in a /26 range being provisioned per node which is 64 IPs. Cluster CIDRs Primary subnet IP range\nDecision: - /26 Rationale: The Primary range is used to assign IPs to nodes in the cluster. With a max of 32 nodes in the cluster, we would need a /27 range. Doubling this range to /26 to support IP exhaustion cases during cluster upgrades or node pool drain. Secondary subnet IP range for pods\nDecision: - /22 Rationale: The secondary subnet IP is used to assign pods in the cluster. With a maximum of 32 pods in a node, we will need a /26 IP range for each node which gives us a total requirement for a 32 nodes cluster of /22 (32*32 = 1024, /22 = 1024) Secondary subnet IP range for services\nDecision: - /25 Rationale: Considering the number of applications getting deployed in this cluster is 26. Keeping a buffer with the introduction of a few new services we can use /25 which is 128 IPs. Conclusion Sizing a Kubernetes cluster is nothing less than an art. Properly sizing a Kubernetes cluster is a crucial step in ensuring optimal performance, resource utilization, and scalability for your applications. I‚Äôve tried to cover the basics here but by carefully considering factors such as HPA, VPA, Quotas and LimitRanges, workload scalability, node capacity, high availability, performance objectives, storage needs, networking considerations, scaling policies, and future growth, you can design a well-sized cluster that meets your application\u0026rsquo;s demands.\nProper cluster sizing involves estimating CPU and memory requirements, selecting suitable worker node instance types, and ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance through multiple nodes. It also requires setting thresholds and policies for scaling based on resource utilization and workload demand, as well as implementing monitoring and observability to continuously monitor the cluster\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nRemember that these sizing guidelines provide a starting point, and the specific requirements may vary based on your workload and application characteristics. Regular monitoring and adjustments are necessary to optimize resource allocation, accommodate growth, and maintain optimal performance.\n","permalink":"http://kishansharma.in/posts/resource-mangement-in-kubernetes-clustersizing-a-kubernetes-cluster/","summary":"Introduction When sizing a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, several factors come into play such as the expected workload, resource requirements, performance needs etc. Similar to performance, scalability is a very critical factor to the success of a growing organisation which should be considered during the design of a cluster.\nScalability of a Kubernetes cluster is not one dimensional but a combination of a lot of components.

Think of it like kernel namespace which is a feature to isolate resources from each other. Analogous to a physical world example, think of it like a store in a shopping mall which has its own physical piece of land, electricity bill, water bill, interior design in a shared shopping complex. The shopping complex is our cluster and the store is a namespace within the cluster. A namespace is a logical boundary that allows you to divide cluster resources and create separate environments for different applications, teams, or projects.\nHow Namespaces create Isolation? Resource isolation using namespaces helps prevent interference between different workloads running on the same Kubernetes cluster. Let‚Äôs see how it can be achieved:\nNamespaced Scope Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, deployments, replica sets belong to a specific namespace. By default, resources are created in the default namespace if no namespace is specified. Each namespace provides an isolated environments where resources can be created and managed. This means that you could have a service called HelloWorld in a production namespace and a different service called HelloWorld in the test namespace and there won‚Äôt be any conflict.\nNamespaces are logically isolated from one another but they can still communicate with services in another namespace.\nService DNS names folllow the SERVICE.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local pattern. Kubernetes DNS service directory can easily locate any service by its name by using the expanded form of DNS addressing. To access HelloWorld service in the production namespace, simply use helloworld.production\nResource Allocation Namespaces allow you to allocate and limit resources separately for different workloads. For example, you can allocate specific amount of CPU and memory resources to a namespace and the resources within the namespace will be constrained by the specified limits. This is done with the help of ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges which are the objects used to control resource usage by the cluster administrator.\nResourceQuota The ResourceQuota is the total allocated resources for a particular namespace\napiVersion: v1 kind: ResourceQuota metadata: name: quota spec: hard: limits.cpu: \u0026#34;50\u0026#34; limits.memory: 100Gi requests.cpu: \u0026#34;25\u0026#34; requests.memory: 50Gi pods: \u0026#34;50\u0026#34; LimitRange LimitRange is used for managing constraints of resource allocation at a pod and container level within the namespace\napiVersion: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34; kind: \u0026#34;LimitRange\u0026#34; metadata: name: \u0026#34;resource-limits\u0026#34; spec: limits: - type: \u0026#34;Pod\u0026#34; max: cpu: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;1Gi\u0026#34; min: cpu: \u0026#34;200m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;6Mi\u0026#34; - type: \u0026#34;Container\u0026#34; max: cpu: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;1Gi\u0026#34; min: cpu: \u0026#34;100m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;4Mi\u0026#34; default: cpu: \u0026#34;300m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;200Mi\u0026#34; defaultRequest: cpu: \u0026#34;200m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;100Mi\u0026#34; maxLimitRequestRatio: cpu: \u0026#34;10\u0026#34; Access Control Namespaces provide a mechanism for access control and permissions. You can define role-based access control(RBAC) policies to grant different levels of access to users or groups for resources within a namespace. This enables fine-grained control over who can access and modify(update) resources within a specific cluster and also within a namespace, enhancing security and isolation. In RBAC there are three components\nUsers and Groups Users are individuals who need access to the cluster, while groups are collections of users with similar roles\nRoles A role is a set of rules that define a set of permissions within a specific namespace. Roles can be created at the namespace level using Roleobject and are used to grant access to resources within the namespace. It is also possible to define the role which has access across the cluster using ClusterRole object\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: namespace: default name: pod-reader rules: - apiGroups: [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] # \u0026#34;\u0026#34; indicates the core API group resources: [\u0026#34;pods\u0026#34;] verbs: [\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;watch\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: # \u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34; omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced name: secret-reader rules: - apiGroups: [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] # # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Secret # objects is \u0026#34;secrets\u0026#34; resources: [\u0026#34;secrets\u0026#34;] verbs: [\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;watch\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings RoleBindings associate a role with a user or a group, granting the defined permissions to the user/group within a specific namespace.\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 # This role binding allows \u0026#34;jane\u0026#34; to read pods in the \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; namespace. # You need to already have a Role named \u0026#34;pod-reader\u0026#34; in that namespace. kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: read-pods namespace: default subjects: # You can specify more than one \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34; - kind: User name: jane # \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; is case sensitive apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: # \u0026#34;roleRef\u0026#34; specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io ClusterRoleBindings on the other hand, associate a role with a user/group across the entire cluster, granting permissions across all namespaces\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 # This role binding allows \u0026#34;dave\u0026#34; to read secrets in the \u0026#34;development\u0026#34; namespace. # You need to already have a ClusterRole named \u0026#34;secret-reader\u0026#34;. kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: read-secrets # # The namespace of the RoleBinding determines where the permissions are granted. # This only grants permissions within the \u0026#34;development\u0026#34; namespace. namespace: development subjects: - kind: User name: dave # Name is case sensitive apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: secret-reader apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io Implementing RBAC enforces strong access controls ensuring that only authorized users/groups have appropriate level of access to cluster resources.\nBy leveraging namespaces, Kubernetes provides a powerful mechanism for isolating and managing resources within a cluster. It allows you to run multiple applications or projects on the same cluster without interference or noisy neighbour problem and provides control over resource allocation, access control, and resource quotas at the namespace level.\n","permalink":"http://kishansharma.in/posts/resource-management-in-kubernetes-clusterisolation-using-namespaces/","summary":"Isolation using Namespaces In Kubernetes, namespaces are a way to create virtual clusters within a physical cluster, providing resource isolation and segregation.

In this post we will look into the resource management in Kubernetes which involves allocating resources such as CPU, memory to the containers running in a cluster\nUnderstanding Resource At the heart of a Kubernetes cluster is a resource abstraction called pods which groups containers together and manage their resources as a unit. Each pod is assigned a certain amount of CPU and memory resources, which are used by the containers running within the pod. Pods run on a node in the cluster and the node size in terms of memory and CPU in a cluster is definite. Only certain number of pods can be run in a cluster and it is a duty of a Kubernetes cluster admin to assign the resources to the pod optimally to get the best utilization and at the same time ensure that there‚Äôs enough room to deal with increasing load and failures.\nKubernetes scheduler decides where to place a pod in the cluster, basically which node has spare resource. In order to schedule pods effectively, the scheduler must know the resource requirements for each pod. This is where Kubernetes resource requests and limits kicks in\nContainer Resource Requests and Limits Kubernetes resource configuration consists of two components: requests and limits.\nrequest specifies the minimum amount of a request that a pod needs to run. limit specifies the maximum amount of resource that a pod is allowed to use. resources: requests: memory: \u0026#34;200Mi\u0026#34; cpu: \u0026#34;400m\u0026#34; limits: memory: \u0026#34;400Mi\u0026#34; cpu: \u0026#34;800m\u0026#34; Setting resource requests and limits allows to accommodate spiky Pods in a cluster. Resource limits are a hard boundary for a pod. A pod that tries to use more than its allocated CPU limit which is a compressible resource will be throttled thus impacting performance and if it tries to use more than the allowed memory limit which is an incompressible resource, the pod gets terminated with OOM error. Scheduler tries to schedule the pod in any other nodes in the cluster if there‚Äôs enough memory in the node. Kubernetes allows resources to be overcommitted which means the sum of all the resource limits of containers on a cluster(node) can exceed the total resources.\nDespite all the efforts put upfront in defining the resource requirements, what happens if the containers are using more resources than allocated. Kubernetes uses Quality of Service (QoS) classes to make a decision about evicting pods in resource crunch situations.\nQuality of Service(QoS) Kubernetes has 3 QoS classes Guaranteed, Burstable, or BestEffort defined. This cannot be assigned directly by you, rather Kubernetes does it for you on the basis of resources defined in the Pod manifest.\nGuaranteed When containers Limits(CPU and Memory) matches requests(CPU and memory). This essentially means that control plane kills this Pod if it exceeds the specified limits.\nNote:¬†If a Container specifies its own memory limit, but does not specify a memory request, Kubernetes automatically assigns a memory request that matches the limit. Similarly, if a Container specifies its own CPU limit, but does not specify a CPU request, Kubernetes automatically assigns a CPU request that matches the limit.\nkubectl get po qos-pod-guaranteed -o yaml spec: containers: ... resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 400Mi limits: cpu: 200m memory: 400Mi ... status: qosClass: Guaranteed Burstable When containers Limits is higher than Requests. Kubernetes allows burstable pods upto their limit if capacity is available in the node. If the pod uses more resources than the request and there‚Äôs not enough resource available in the node, the pod gets terminated.\nkubectl get po qos-pod-burstable -o yaml spec: containers: ... resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 400Mi limits: cpu: 400m memory: 800Mi ... status: qosClass: Burstable BestEffort When containers doesn‚Äôt specify any resource request or limits. In this situation pods are allowed to use whatever resource is available on the node but it will be the first one to be killed when the cluster needs to make room for higher(Burstable/Guaranteed) QoS pods.\nWhat should you do? In the first instance it seems that Guaranteed is the best QoS class to set for the pods. But remember resource(memory/CPU) has some cost üí∞. Let us try and understand how this can be approached. Considering we have a definite resource at hand and if we want to set request and limits equal(Guaranteed QoS class) we have to either increase requests or lower the limits. In case of increasing the resource, we might be blocking too much of resource unnecessarily and some other Pod which could have been scheduled in the node is not getting the resource. If we lower the Limit, the pod might throttle during the peak/spike hours. This seems like a similar territory when VMs are used.\nScheduling of a Pod is based on requests and not limits\nThe place where Kubernetes is different from the conventional resource allocation is when we use Burstable pods. Here, the amount of resource blocked by the pod is lower than the amount of resource pod needs during surge hours.\nPods with QoS class as BestEffort gets the lowest priority. If resource is not specified, Kubernetes scheduler will place such pods on any of the node which has available resource.\nDuring the eviction, Kubelet selects the Pods to evict in order of QoS class. Pods classified as BestEffort will be first evicted followed by Burstable and finally Guaranteed.\nAlways specify resource requests and limits. This helps Kubernetes schedule and manage the pods properly. For critical pods or stateful sets, prefer Guaranteed class and Burstable for the less critical ones\n","permalink":"http://kishansharma.in/posts/resource-mangement-in-kubernetes-clusterunderstanding-resources/","summary":"Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that allows you to manage and automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerised application.

In Kubernetes, Prometheus can be used to monitor various Kubernetes components such as pods, nodes, and services. Kubernetes provides an API that allows Prometheus to discover the endpoints of the different components and collect metrics from them. These metrics can include CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and other relevant information. Prometheus also provides a variety of built-in visualization tools such as Grafana, which can be used to visualize the collected metrics. This allows users to create dashboards that provide a high-level view of the cluster\u0026rsquo;s health and performance.\nThere are fundamentally two things that we can monitor in kubernetes system\nMonitor applications running on kubernetes infrastructure Monitor kubernetes cluster control plane components such as coreDNS, apiserver, kube scheduler kubelet(cAdvisor) which exposes container metrics kube-state-metrics which is basically the cluster level metrics around deployments, pod etc node-exporter which runs on all the nodes and exposes metrics around CPU, memory, network. Node exporter can be run on a kubernetes cluster in the following ways manually run in each nodes in the cluster use kubernetes daemonset which allows to run pod of node-exporter in all the nodes in the cluster Kubernetes doesn‚Äôt expose these metrics by default. For that we need to install kube state metrics container into our kubernetes environment and this container is responsible for making it available to the prometheus server.\nDeploying Prometheus There are multiple options to deploy prometheus.\nManually deploy premotheus on kubernetes. this requires manually creating all the deployments, configmaps, services secrets etc. Deploy using Helm chart to deploy prometheus operator Operators in Kubernetes A kubernetes operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a kubernetes application. A Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user.\nPrometheus operator The Prometheus Operator provides Kubernetes native deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components. The Prometheus operator includes the following features:\nKubernetes Custom Resources: Use Kubernetes custom resources to deploy and manage Prometheus, AlertManager, and related components. Simplified Deployment Configuration: Configure the fundamentals of Prometheus like versions, persistence, retention policies, and replicas from a native Kubernetes resource. Prometheus Target Configuration: Automatically generate monitoring target configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries; no need to learn a Prometheus specific configuration language. user guide\nThis operator comes with several resources such as AlertManager, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, PrometheusRule, AlertManager config\nService Monitors The Prometheus operator comes with several custom resource definitions that provide a high level abstraction for deploying prometheus.\nkubectl get crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com 2023-04-24T12:28:54Z prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com 2023-04-24T12:28:54Z Service monitors define a set of targets for prometheus to monitor and scrape.

This index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns. The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned.\nCover-Index An index containing all the columns needed for a query, which is there in the select statement.\nUnique Index A unique index is an index used to enforce uniqueness of a column\u0026rsquo;s value or the uniqueness of a combined value of more than one column.\nOne of the most misunderstood concepts around indexing is to understand where to use a primary key, unique constraint, or unique index. Let\u0026rsquo;s understand this using a problem:\nProblem statement We require maximum performance with no duplicate data. Which is the better approach? Primary key, unique constraint or unique index?\nSolution Note: Multiple null values are not equal, so they are not considered as a duplicate record.\nPostgres automatically creates a unique index in the table when a primary key and unique constraint is defined in the table. Creating unique constraint then would be redundant, and unnecessarily creating indexes degrades the performance of Postgres. According to suggestions by the Postgres product team, create a unique constraint on the table and then there is no need to create a unique index on those columns. Postgres creates an index for the defined primary key itself When we create a unique constraint, Postgres automatically creates an index behind the scene. However, there are cases where even indexing can\u0026rsquo;t improve performance. One such case is when we do case-insensitive searches. Let\u0026rsquo;s understand the difference between the query cost in case of case sensitive and case insensitive search in our scheme table. Given we have an index on the column scheme_name.\nEXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes where scheme_name = \u0026#39;weekend_scheme\u0026#39; QUERY PLAN | Index scan using idx_scheme_name on schemes (cost=0.28..8.29 rows=1 width=384) Planning Time: 0.155 ms Execution Time: 0.063ms\nEXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes where lower(scheme_name) = \u0026#39;weekend_scheme\u0026#39; QUERY PLAN | Seq Scan on schemes (cost=0.00..69.00 rows=5 width=384) Filter: (lower((scheme_name)¬†:: text) = \u0026lsquo;weekend_scheme\u0026rsquo;¬†:: text) Rows removed by filter: 999 Planning Time: 0.119 ms Execution Time: 0.721ms\nEven though we have an index created at scheme_name, the function lower degrades the performance as it does an additional effort of converting all the values of scheme_table to lower case.\nCases when an index is not used (although it is defined).\nLIKE '%scheme' will never use an index, but LIKE 'scheme%' can possibly use the index. The upper/lower case function used in where clause. So whenever we want to use a function in our where clause, we could create the index in the following way to optimise the query.\nCREATE INDEX idx_scheme_name ON schemes (lower(scheme_name)) EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes where lower(scheme_name) = \u0026#39;weekend_scheme\u0026#39; QUERY PLAN | Bitmap heap scan on schemes ((cost=4.32..19.83 rows=5 width=384)) Recheck cond: (lower ((scheme_name)¬†:: text) = \u0026lsquo;weekend_scheme\u0026rsquo;¬†:: text) Heap Blocks: exact=1 Bitmap scan on schemes ((cost=0.00..4.32 rows=5 width=0)) Index cond: (lower ((scheme_name)¬†:: text) = \u0026lsquo;weekend_scheme\u0026rsquo;¬†:: text) Planning Time: 1.784 ms Execution Time: 0.079 ms\nPartial Index Postgres supports an index over a subset of the rows of a table (known as a partial index). It\u0026rsquo;s often the best way to index our data if we want to repeatedly analyse rows that match a given WHERE clause. Let us see how we can enhance the performance of Postgres using partial indexing.\nProblem statement We want to return all the schemes which are supposed to run before 11:00 am.\nSolution EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes WHERE start_time \u0026lt; \u0026#39;10:00:00\u0026#39; QUERYEXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes where lower(scheme_name) = \u0026lsquo;weekend_scheme\u0026rsquo; PLAN | Seq Scan on schemes (cost=0.00..66.50 rows=9 width=23) Filter: (start_time \u0026lt; \u0026lsquo;10:00:00\u0026rsquo;) Rows removed by filter: 991 Planning Time: 0.082 ms Execution Time: 0.226 ms\nWe can create an index on start_time column but assuming we have a huge database, this may not be optimal for insert, update and delete. So we create an index with a condition. This kind of indexing is used when we know what we need from our select queries. Say we do a heavy read on all the schemes which are started before 10:00:00 and not much when started later.\nCREATE INDEX idx_scheme_name ON schemes start_time WHERE start_time \u0026lt; \u0026#39;11:00:00\u0026#39; EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes WHERE start_time \u0026lt; \u0026#39;10:00:00\u0026#39; QUERY PLAN | Bitmap heap scan on schemes ((cost=4.21..29.30 rows=9 width=23)) Recheck cond: (start_time \u0026lt; \u0026lsquo;10:00:00\u0026rsquo;) Heap Blocks: exact=8 Bitmap index scan on schemes ((cost=0.00..4.21 rows=9 width=0) Index cond: (start_time \u0026lt; \u0026lsquo;10:00:00\u0026rsquo;) Planning Time: 1.729 ms Execution Time: 0.075 ms\nThis reduces the execution time from 0.226to 0.075. Let\u0026rsquo;s validate that we have not indexed all the schemes where start_time is after 11:00 AM.\nEXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM schemes WHERE start_time \u0026gt;\u0026#39;12:00:00\u0026#39; QUERY PLAN | Seq Scan on schemes (cost=0.00..66.50 rows=6 width=23) Filter: (start_time \u0026lt; \u0026lsquo;12:00:00\u0026rsquo;) Rows removed by filter: 993 Planning Time: 0.101 ms Execution Time: 0.228ms\nThis proves that partial data from schemes table is indexed and the rest of the data is not indexed. Our index size is very small and easy to maintain, helping in the maintaining task of reindexing.\nQuery plan on¬†JOINS The optimizer needs to pick the correct join algorithm when there are multiple tables to be joined in the select statement. Postgres uses 3 different kinds of join algorithm based on the type of join we are using.\nNested Loop: Here, the planner can use either sequential scan or index scan for each of the elements in the first table. The planner uses a sequential scan when the second table is small. The basic logic of choosing between a sequential scan and index scan applies here too. Hash Join: In this algorithm, the planner creates a hash table of the smaller table on the join key. The larger table is then scanned, searching the hash table for the rows which meet the join condition. This requires a lot of memory to store the hash table in the first place. Merge Join: This is similar to merge sort algorithm. Here the planner sorts both the tables to be joined on the join attribute. The tables are then scanned in parallel to find the matching values.\nEXPLAIN SELECT schemes.rules FROM scheme_rules JOIN schemes ON (scheme_rules.scheme_id = schemes.id ) where scheme_name = \u0026#39;weekend_scheme\u0026#39;; Downsides of indexes in production environments Finding unused¬†indexes In a large production environment, finding unused indexes is advisable, because indexes eat memory. Postgres wiki page details how we can find index summary, duplicate indexes, and index size.\nCREATE/DROP index vs CREATE/DROP index concurrently Creating and dropping an index in a large database can take hours or even days and the CREATE INDEX command blocks all the writes on a table (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t block the reads, but this is still not ideal).\nHowever, an index created concurrently with CREATE INDEX CONCURRENT will not acquire locks against writes. When creating index concurrently, Postgres first scans the table to build indexes and runs the index once again for the things to be added since the first pass.\nCreating an index concurrently also has a downside though. If something goes wrong during the process, it does not roll back, and leaves an invalid index behind. Invalid indexes can be found using the following query.\nSELECT * FROM pg_class, pg_index WHERE pg_index.indisvalid = false AND pg_index.indexrelid = pg_class.oid; Rebuilding indexes REINDEX rebuilds an index using the data stored in the index table, replacing the old copy of the index. If we suspect corruption of an index on a table, we can simply rebuild that index, or all indexes on the table, using REINDEX INDEX or REINDEX TABLE\nREINDEX is similar to a drop and recreate of the index in that the index contents are rebuilt from scratch. However, locking considerations are rather different. REINDEX locks out writes but not reads of the index\u0026rsquo;s parent table. It also takes an exclusive lock on the specific index being processed, which will block reads that attempt to use that index.\nAnother option is to drop index concurrently and create again concurrently.\nConclusion This post aimed to provide an overview of how Postgres queries the database. By understanding query plans better and carefully taking measures (mostly through indexes), we can get the best performance out of the Postgres database.\nFurther Reading Index locking consideration Locking indexes Routine reindexing Examining index usage Monitoring stats ","permalink":"http://kishansharma.in/posts/postgres-performance-tuning-manualindexes/","summary":"In this post, we look at how to overcome slow queries by analysing them with Explain and Analyze, and using indexes to modify and enhance the query timings.\nPostgres supports different kinds of indexing on the table for querying faster.\nMultiple column¬†indexes A multi-column B-Tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index\u0026rsquo;s columns.

A lot of major companies use Postgres as their main database however when you\u0026rsquo;re building and operating at scale, the volume of data passing through the pipelines can slow down the most efficient systems.\nTo optimise things in order to enhace performace, we can target the brain of the database whhich is optimizer. Optimizer interprets queries and determines the fastest method of execution. A single query optimization technique can increase database performance drastically.\nThis post outlines how to analyse Postgres performance using tools such as EXPLAIN and ANALYZE (which Postgres provides).\nMeet EXPLAIN \u0026amp;¬†ANALYZE EXPLAIN gives an exact breakdown of a query. The execution plan is based on the statistics about the table, and it identifies the most efficient path to the data. This takes different database paradigms (such as indexes) into consideration. EXPLAIN only guesses a plan that it thinks it will execute. This is where ANALYZE comes into the picture. ANALYZE basically runs a query to find the processing time to execute a query.\nTo quickly summarise, EXPLAIN and ANALYZE commands help improve database performance in Postgres by:\na. Displaying the execution plan that the PostgreSQL planner generates for the supplied statement.\nb. Actually running the command to show the run time.\nFinding the framework Let\u0026rsquo;s consider we have a table named schemes.\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM schemes; QUERY PLAN | Seq Scan on schemes (cost=0.00..64 rows=328 width=479)\nSELECT * FROM pg_class where relname = \u0026#39;schemes\u0026#39;; pg_class has the metadata about the tables.\nCost in the query plan is calculated using the following formula\nCOST = (disk read pages x seq_page_cost) + (rows scanned x cpu_tuple_cost).\nDisk read pages and rows scanned are the properties of pg_class. Seq page cost is the estimated cost of disk read fetch. Cpu tuple cost is the estimated cost of processing each row. eg., COST (54 x 1.0) + (1000 x¬†.01) = 64 Let\u0026rsquo;s see how the query plan changes when we apply filters in the select statement.\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM schemes WHERE status = \u0026#39;active\u0026#39;; QUERY PLAN | Seq Scan on schemes (cost=0.00..66.50 rows=960 width=384) Filter: ((status)::text = \u0026lsquo;active\u0026rsquo;::text)\nThe estimated cost here is higher than the previous query, this is because Postgres is performing a seq scan over 1000 rows first and then filtering out the rows based on the WHERE clause.\nPlanner cost constants The cost variables described in this section are measured on an arbitrary scale. Only their relative values matter, hence scaling them all up or down by the same factor will result in no change in the planner\u0026rsquo;s choices. By default, these cost variables are based on the cost of sequential page fetches; that is, seq_page_cost is conventionally set to 1.0 and the other cost variables are set with reference to that. But you can use a different scale if you prefer, such as actual execution times in milliseconds on a particular machine.\nUnfortunately, there is no well-defined method for determining ideal values for the cost variables. They are best treated as averages over the entire mix of queries that a particular installation will receive. This means that changing them on the basis of just a few experiments is very risky. Refer planner cost constants].\nEXPLAIN SELECT schemes.rules FROM scheme_rules JOIN schemes ON (scheme_rules.scheme_id = schemes.id ) where scheme_name = \u0026#39;weekend_scheme\u0026#39;; The query planner sometimes decides to use a two-step plan. The reason for using two-plan node is the first plan sorts the row locations identified by the index into physical order before reading them, and the other plan actually fetches those rows from the table.\nDown to the nuts and¬†bolts The first plan which does the sorting is called Bitmap scan.\nMost common occurring matches are scanned using the seq scan and the least common matches are scanned using index scan, anything in between is scanned using bitmap heap scan followed by an index scan. One of the reasons for this is that the random I/O is very slow as compared to sequential I/O. This is all driven by analysing statistics.\nBitmap heap scan A bitmap heap scan is like a seq scan‚Ää-‚Ääthe difference being, rather than visiting every disk page, it scans ANDs and ORs of the applicable index together and only visits the disk pages it needs to visit. This is different from index scan where the index is visited row by row in order, which results in disk pages being visited multiple times. A bitmap scan will sequentially open a short list of disk pages and grab every applicable row in each one.\nSequential scan vs index scan There are cases where a sequential scan is faster than an index scan. When reading data from a disk, a sequential method is usually faster than reading in random order. This is because an index scan requires several I/O for each row which includes looking up a row in the index, and based on that, looking up and retrieving the row from memory(heap). On the other hand, a sequential scan requires a single I/O operation to retrieve more than one block containing multiple rows.\nQuery plan on¬†JOINS The optimizer needs to pick the correct join algorithm when there are multiple tables to be joined in the select statement.

Steps for the same:\nMark the nodes in the existing node pool to be non schedulable by using the kubernetes cordon command\nkubectl cordon \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;\nRedeploy the application and verify if the nodes are scheduling in the nodes of new node pool\nOnce verified, redeploy and move all the workloads in the new node pool.\nClean up and delete the old node pool.\n","permalink":"http://kishansharma.in/posts/extend-cidr/","summary":"A VPC native cluster uses three unique subnet ranges to allocate IPs to Nodes, Pods and Services.\nPrimary subnet IP address is used for Nodes. Node IP provides connectivity from control components like kube-proxy and kubelet to the Kubernetes API server. Node IP is the node‚Äôs connection to the rest of the cluster.\nSecondary subnet IP address is used for Pods. Pod IP addresses are natively routable within the cluster‚Äôs VPC network and other VPC networks connected to it by VPC Network Peering.","title":"Extend CIDR"}]
